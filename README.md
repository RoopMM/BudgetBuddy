# BudgetBuddy
**Group Members : Jatin Sharma, Jashanpreet Singh and Roop Malhans


**Project Overview

The idea of our group is to build an application for the people who find it hard to manage their expenses. The user can put their monthly income and expenses from different sources, our application will automatically categorise the expenses into different categories, and tell users where they are spending most of their money. Apart from this, our application will give users tips on where they can save money, for example, grocery items, travel tickets, etcetera. BudgetBuddy will also show users when they can retire by calculating their savings, mortgage, and car payments apart from government pension plans and what they can afford by then. By calculating the user's savings and depending on the type of expenses the user has, BudgetBuddy will show more investment options to their buddies. For instance, if a user does not own a car, it will show them which car they can afford with their savings, and if the user likes to invest in the stock market or cryptocurrency, it will calculate which option will yield the most return on their investment. 
Our application, for now, will be for Android users but to expand in the future, we can try to make it hybrid and desktop based on the user’s response. To build our mobile Application- BudgetBuddy, we will use Android Studio and Kotlin, we will use Google’s Cloud Firestore, and other Google Cloud Platforms for cloud computing.
